# SEVENS (C++)
This is a simple card game called "Sevens" created in C++. This is my first project in C++ after reading through learncpp.com!
## How to play?
- First the deck of cards is dealt. The deck has 52 cards.
- The first card to be played is a 7 of any suit.
- The next card that can be played is either a 7 of a different suit, or a 6 or 8 of the same suit.
- Keep putting cards from ascending or decending from 7.
- If you can't put a card down, you have to pass.
- Ace is the lowest card (below 2) and King is the highest card.
- The first person to have no cards left wins!
